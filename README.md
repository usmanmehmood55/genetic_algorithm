# Genetic Algorithm

This project is the implementation of a genetic algorithm in C. This implementation does not adhere to the exact steps taken
by a genetic algorithm, it was more of an inspiration. The application, and the subsequent paragraph were taken from the
highly informative [article by Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/)

## What is a Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms(GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. 
Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. These are intelligent exploitation of random 
search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space. They are 
commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.

Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection which means those species who can adapt to changes in their 
environment are able to survive and reproduce and go to next generation. In simple words, they simulate “survival of the 
fittest” among individual of consecutive generation for solving a problem. Each generation consist of a population of 
individuals and each individual represents a point in search space and possible solution. Each individual is represented as 
a string of character/integer/float/bits. This string is analogous to the Chromosome.
